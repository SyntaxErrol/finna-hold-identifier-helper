# Finna Hold Identifier Helper
Display your Finna library Hold Identifier on your Holds page. This thing will
really kick ass once user script host extensions get enabled on Firefox mobile.

Tested with OUTI Libraries, no reason it shouldn't with other libraries in the
network. Let me know if yours needs a fix of some kind.
